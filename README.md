```
npm run Devstart
```
inside the API folder inside of the src folder in the client folder to run the API for the app to work


## How it works
using React TS and nodeJS to build the app
### Frontend
the frontend was made with React and styled with CSS
### backend/API
the API was built with nodeJS using an Express server
the API simply takes the binary number from the frontend and converts it to a decimal number and sends it to the frontend
